# AssociateSocialMediaManager

Hi!, my name is Britney and I thank you for checking out my resume and my Github. Before I came upon your job posting, I came upon Github. As an IT college student once, I relied and grew with Github as I became a developer. I'm now in marketing and it is because I realized that having a tech background and marketing experience is such a great combo that it pushed me into walking into a new industry. The opportunity to work at Github sounds and is amazing. As your Associate Social Media Manager, I will use my IT background to connect with the developer community and my marketing skills to do it all to the best of my ability. It would be an honor to work with like-minded people and contribute to the mission and growth of Github.
